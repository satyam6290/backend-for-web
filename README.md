# Backend Web Development Repository

Welcome to the Backend Web Development Repository!

## Overview

This repository contains backend code and resources for developing web applications and APIs. Whether you're a beginner learning backend development or an experienced developer building robust server-side functionalities, you'll find valuable resources here to power your web projects.

## Contents

- **server.js**: The main server file containing the backend code for your web application or API.
- Additional backend files for routing, middleware, database connections, authentication, and other functionalities.
- Configuration files (e.g., `.env`, `.config`) for environment variables, database settings, and other configurations.
- Database schema files (e.g., `.sql`, `.json`, `.yaml`) defining the structure of your database tables, models, and relationships.
- Documentation files (e.g., README.md, API documentation) describing the backend architecture, endpoints, and usage instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

2. Set up your backend environment:

   - Install Node.js and npm if not already installed.
   - Install dependencies using npm:

     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. Customize the backend code and configuration according to your project requirements.

4. Run the backend server:

   ```
